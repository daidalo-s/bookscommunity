# BooksCommunity

This project was developed as part of the Web Technologies course at the University of Turin.
It is a website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and a MySQL database.
The primary focus of the website is to create a community for book reviews.

## Functionalities

Users can:
- Sign up, log in, and delete their accounts.
- Post new reviews.
- Explore reviews through the home feed, search bar, or a "One Random Review" button.
- Upvote, downvote, or report reviews.
- The admin user has the ability to manage users, including banning them.

## Code

The website features a fully responsive layout (without using any specific frameworkâ€”just plain HTML/CSS/JS).
The PHP backend is designed following web services principles, with APIs that are called by the frontend.
The code is structured to be as modular and reusable as possible.
